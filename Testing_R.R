#In this lesson, we linked Git and RStudio, so that RStudio recognizes you are using Git as your version control software. Following that, we linked RStudio to GitHub, so that you can push and pull repositories from within RStudio. To test this, we created a repository on GitHub, linked it with a new project within RStudio, created a new file, and then staged, committed, and pushed the file to your GitHub repository!
